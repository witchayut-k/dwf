		Helpers
		
		The helpers/ folder (sometimes called utils/) gathers all Sass tools and helpers we’ll use across the project. Got a function? A mixin? Put it in there. This folder also contains a _variables.scss file (sometimes _config.scss) which holds all global variables for the project (for typography, color schemes, and so on).
